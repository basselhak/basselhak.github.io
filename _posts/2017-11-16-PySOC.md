Together with [Javier Garcia-Bernardo](http://www.javiergb.com/index.html) at the University of Amsterdam, I’ve started a Google Group for people who are interested in learning and using Python for social science.

The group is called PySOC and you can join it here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pysoc

Feel free to distribute it to others who might be interested. The purpose of the group is just to have a central place of exchange where we can share guides, code snippets, best practices, ideas, and general discussion.

We couldn’t find a similar list or group online, so we thought we might as well go about creating it ourselves. As it still seems like early days for Python in social science, we think it would be useful to have a better idea of who is currently working with Python and what they are doing.
