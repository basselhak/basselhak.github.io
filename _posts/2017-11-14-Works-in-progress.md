Here's a list of things I'm currently working on:

- On the [ENLIGHTEN](http://enlightenproject.eu/) Project, I have two main deliverables:
  - An independent study on brain drain - currently published as a working paper [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/research/researchcentres/csgr/papers/285-17.pdf) and with some follow-up data analysis [here](https://github.com/basselhak/braindrain). I'm getting this ready for submission.
  - A co-authored study on how firms in Germany and Japan respond to demographic challenges with [Eleni Tsingou](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-business-and-politics/staff/etdbp) and [Leonard Seabrooke](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-business-and-politics/staff/lsdbp). Still in the early stages.
- In connection to [GEM-STONES](https://gem-stones.eu/), I am co-editing a book with [George Christou](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/christou/) at Warwick on *Networks and the European Union: Threats and Opportunities of Complexity*. The book project will be submitted to Routledge.
- I've co-organized two workshops with [Krystel Wanneau](http://philoscsoc.ulb.be/en/users/kwanneau) and [Sameea Ahmed-Hassim](https://gem-stones.eu/people/sameea-ahmed-hassim) on the topic of experts and expertise in Science and Technology Studies and International Relations. We are exploring ways of publishing the output of these workshops.
