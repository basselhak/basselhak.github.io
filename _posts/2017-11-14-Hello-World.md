Welcome to my personal website! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Lund University's Department of Political Science. I am currently working on the politics and governance of plastics, in particular on questions of sustainability and decarbonisation. Read more [here](/about). You can get in touch with me by using one of the icons in the page footer below.

The purpose of this site is to create a landing page or hub that connects my various online presences, such as my profiles at Academia.edu, Researchgate.net, LinkedIn, and so on. I will also use this site to showcase certain pieces of research or works-in-progress.

This site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) theme and built using this [guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
