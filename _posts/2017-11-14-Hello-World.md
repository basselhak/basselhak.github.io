title: We're up and running!

My personal website is now online. The purpose of this site is to create a landing page or hub that connects my various online presences, such as my profiles at Academia.edu, Researchgate.net, LinkedIn, and so on. I will also use this site to showcase my research and projects, and add blog posts every now and then with reflections and commentary on my works-in-progress. 

I used the [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) theme to get up and running real quick. The site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I followed [this guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) to get everything working.
