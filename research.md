# Research interests and themes

The overarching theme that runs through my research is the interaction between bureaucracy and innovation. I am particularly interested in understanding how disruptive and controversial technologies challenge policymakers by instigating contentious public debates. In these debates, policymakers, business representatives, technical/scientific experts, NGOs, and the general public collide in dizzying and shifting patterns of action and talk. My job is to find signals in this noise, and I do so with a broad array of tools, theories, and methods.

- Innovation, technological change, disruption
- European Union, transnational regulation & governance, public policy
- Framing, lobbying, collective action
