The overarching theme that runs through my research is the interaction between governance and innovation. I am particularly interested in understanding how disruptive and controversial technologies challenge policymakers, experts, and publics. I draw on a range of perspectives from political economy, sociology, and science and technology studies.

### Publications

My research has been published in the *Journal of European Public Policy* and the *Journal of Professions and Organization*.
