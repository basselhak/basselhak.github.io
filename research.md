title: Research interests and themes
---

The overarching theme that runs through my research is the interaction between bureaucracy and innovation. I am particularly interested in understanding how disruptive and controversial technologies challenge policymakers by instigating contentious public debates. In these debates, policymakers, business representatives, technical/scientific experts, NGOs, and the general public collide in dizzying and shifting patterns of action and talk. My job is to find signals in this noise, and I do so with a broad array of tools, theories, and methods.

- Innovation, technological change, disruption
- European Union, transnational regulation & governance, public policy
- Framing, lobbying, collective action

# Methods and tools

My approach to social science research is eclectic, and I don't shy away from a particular set of tools or theories if they don't fit my current paradigm. I think it's more important to ask good questions and find compelling case studies than to commit to one particular way of viewing the world.

Having said that, because of the things that interest me and the questions I've asked, I've tended to gravitate towards approaches that take discourse, culture and network relations seriously as organizing concepts in the study of society. I normally start any research project with a deep dive into the empirical field in question through interviews, ethnography, and desk research, and then follow up later with more formal ways of working with and reflecting on the data. [Clifford Geertz](http://hypergeertz.jku.at/GeertzTexts/Natives_Point.htm) calls this balancing the experience-near with the experience-distant modes of inquiry.
