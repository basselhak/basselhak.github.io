I am currently working as a postdoc at Lund University's [Department of Political Science](https://www.svet.lu.se/) on two research projects investigating the politics and governance of plastics, in particular on questions of decarbonisation and sustainability.

### Bio

I hold a PhD in political and social science from an Erasmus Mundus dual-degree doctorate program called [GEM](http://www.erasmusmundus-gem.eu/) ("Globalization, Europe and Multilateralism"), now [GEM-STONES](https://gem-stones.eu/). During my PhD, I was affiliated to the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom and L'Université libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, with visits to Université Laval in Canada and Copenhagen Business School, Denmark. My dissertation was on the interaction between innovation and governance in cases of controversial technologies. I studied two examples of this and how they were treated at the level of the European Union: hydraulic fracturing and electronic cigarettes. Following the PhD, I spent one year as a postdoc on the ENLIGHTEN project ('European Legitimacy in Governing through Hard Times: The Role of European Networks', Horizon 2020 Project Grant No. 649456), studying European crisis management and the issues of brain drain and demographic change.
